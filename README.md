# Agents Manifesto

```
Because obviously what the world was missing was another manifesto.
This one keeps AI agents from turning into confident chaos machines.
```

A tiny document with a big mission: to stop AI agents from acting like unsupervised interns on caffeine.

This manifesto exists for one reason: people keep giving AI vague instructions and then acting surprised when it confidently makes everything worse.

So we wrote down some basic rules —
not for the machines, but for the humans using them.

Drop it into AGENTS.md, pretend you’re disciplined, and enjoy slightly fewer disasters.
