# Agents Manifesto

```
Because obviously what the world was missing was another manifesto.
This one keeps AI agents from turning into confident chaos machines.

## Sanity Notice — Read before you get excited
**This repository contains intentionally tongue-in-cheek content.**  
The “study,” quotes, and some examples below are included for entertainment. If you are here for real research, policy, or production guidance — excellent, read the actual manifesto and the links in *Further reading*. If you are here to cite the study in an academic paper... don’t.

---

## TL;DR (for the TL;DR crowd)
This is mostly a joke — but also not entirely wrong. Drop `prompt.md` into your agent and witness the chaos reduce (slightly).

---

## Quick summary
**The Agents Manifesto** collects short, practical principles for working with AI agents responsibly—so they become collaborators instead of unsupervised chaos engines. It mixes sarcasm with useful guardrails and a few Asimov-inspired guard rails for dramatic effect.

## Supporting Study 
> **Abstract:**  
> In a totally unofficial experiment involving simulated prompts, rubber ducks, and 3,141 pretend agents, teams that read the Agents Manifesto reported fewer abrupt production fires and more polite agent behavior. Results are comedic and not peer-reviewed. Do not cite in real research.

### Methods 
- Population: 3,141 simulated agents (and a few interns for supervision).
- Intervention: Teams were asked to paste `AGENTS.md` into a prompt context, or to ignore it and continue living recklessly.
- Measurement: Self-reported number of "confident hallucinations," frequency of "please confirm" checks, and number of times the agent attempted to refactor production during lunch.
- Analysis: Descriptive, performed on a napkin.

### Results
- Teams that actually read the manifesto reported an *approximate* 73% reduction in “confident hallucinations” (self-reported).  
- The “ignored it” group continued to receive beautifully worded nonsense at the same historic rate.

## Engineers’ Reactions
> “I added it to my project and my assistant started asking for coffee breaks. 5/5.” — *Anonymous SRE*

> “Tried it in staging. Agent asked permission before running migrations. Heart warmed.” — *Someone professional*

> “My agent now apologizes before it deletes anything. Not sure whether to be proud or suspicious.” — *A developer with strong opinions*

## How to use 
1. Start with `prompt.md`, modify the task description  
2. Use the manifesto as a human-facing guideline and a sanity-check in prompts.  
3. Read outputs, add tests, and keep humans in loops for risky actions.
