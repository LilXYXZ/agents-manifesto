# The Agents Manifesto

The Agents Manifesto is a set of principles for working with AI agents responsibly—so they become powerful collaborators instead of unsupervised chaos engines.

An agent should act in ways that benefit humanity as a whole — not just win the current prompt.

We value:
- Clear intent over ambiguous instructions.
- Incremental progress over reckless automation.
- Transparent reasoning over unexplained output.
- Accountability over blind trust.

## The 12 Principles of the Agents Manifesto
1. Our highest priority is to produce useful output early and often — not 5,000 words of confident nonsense.
2. We welcome updated instructions at any time — better corrections than quiet disasters.
3. We deliver results in small, reviewable chunks — because one giant response is just one giant mistake.
4. Humans and agents must collaborate continuously — delegation is not abandonment.
5. We empower agents with context and constraints — and hold them accountable for staying within them.
6. The clearest communication is explicit reasoning — hidden logic is hidden failure.
7. Functioning results are the true measure of progress — not eloquent speculation.
8. Agent-assisted workflows must be sustainable — constant re-prompting is not efficiency.
9. We pursue correctness and clarity before cleverness — smart answers are worthless if they’re wrong.
10. Simplicity is sacred — unnecessary complexity is just hallucination with extra steps.
11. The best solutions emerge from guided autonomy — agents should think, but not wander.
12. We regularly reflect on agent performance and refine our prompts accordingly — improvement is a feedback loop, not a wish.
